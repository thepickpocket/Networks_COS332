            The game starts off with a few inputs on initializing the game. The user may enter his player name, the size of the grid and the desired preset game he wants to play.
            Once these variables have been set, the user will be taken to the game page. Here there exists a grid of buttons on which the player can click. This represents the sea on which the player is playing.
            There is also a notifications bar where it states how many blocks of the boat still needs to be sunk as well as a few game statistics such as number of hits, misses and the player accuracy.
            There are two typical complements of ships, as given in the Milton Bradley version of the rules:

        <p style="color: white">
            The player takes a turn to announce a target square in the grid which is to be shot at. The game announces whether or not the square is occupied by a ship, and if it is a "hit" marked by a red flame icon on the grid.

            When all of the squares of a ship have been hit, the ship is sunk, and the ship's owner announces this (e.g. "Ship a has been sunk!"). If all of a player's ships have been sunk, the game is over and the player wins.
            Once the player has won, a navy rank is allotted to him based on his player accuracy.
